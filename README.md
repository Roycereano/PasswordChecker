# Password Strength Checker

A very simple Python program that checks for password strength based on length. 

## Features 
✅ Checks for password strength based on length at least 4 characters in length. 
✅ Feedback is given based on strength of password and a message is presented to the user. 
✅ Will ask to re-renter password if password doesn't meet the minimum 4 characters. 

## Installation and Usage 
- Simply clone the repository and run it in your desired terminal or IDE. 
- If running in a terminal make sure to run "Python3 passwordchecker.py" 

## Future Improvements
- Will be working on better output and customization for detecting special characters and combo of Upper and lower case letters. 
- For now it simply checks for length of password.
